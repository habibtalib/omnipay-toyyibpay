# Omnipay: toyyibPay

**toyyibPay driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP. This package implements toyyibPay support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply require `league/omnipay` and `sitehandy/omnipay-toyyibpay` with Composer:

```
composer require league/omnipay sitehandy/omnipay-toyyibpay
```

## Basic Usage

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

## Category & Bill

Each payment is a `Bill`, which is under a `Category`. To begin, you need to register at [toyyibPay.com](https://toyyibpay.com/e/2238297686400) and create a Category, then retrieve the `Category Code` for the gateway setup.

## Example

### How to create a Bill (purchase request)
https://toyyibpay.com/apireference/

The example below explains how you can create a toyyibPay Bill and then redirect user to the payment page.

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('ToyyibPay');

$gateway->setTestMode(1); // use sandbox mode for testing

$options = [
    'userSecretKey' => 'YOURSECRETKEY',
    'categoryCode' => 'CATEGORYCODE',
    'billName' => 'Product Name',
    'billDescription' => 'Product Description',
    'billPriceSetting'=> 0,
    'billPayorInfo'=> 1,
    'billAmount'=> 1,
    'billReturnUrl'=>'https://yourwebsite.com/returnurl',
    'billCallbackUrl'=>'https://yourwebsite.com/callbackurl',
    'billExternalReferenceNo' => 'ORDER123',
    'billTo'=>'Customer Name',
    'billEmail'=>'customer@sampleemail.test',
    'billPhone'=>'0123456789',
    'billSplitPayment'=> 0,
    'billSplitPaymentArgs'=>'',
    'billPaymentChannel'=> 0,
    'billDisplayMerchant'=> 1,
    'billContentEmail' => 'Sample email content',
    'billChargeToCustomer' => 2
];

$response = $gateway->purchase($options)->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful())
{
    // For bill creation, bill status is false and should be redirected to the payment gateway
}
elseif ($response->isRedirect())
{
    // Do whatever you want here for example saving the data to the database etc
    // and then redirect the customer to the offsite payment gateway
    // Note: match and save the bill id into your order table
    // to get the bill id, return the following response: $response->getData()['BillCode'];

    $response->redirect();
}
else
{
    // Display error message
    exit($response->getMessage());
}
```


### How to get Bill Transactions (complete purchase)

https://toyyibpay.com/apireference/

The code below gives an example how to retrieve the bill transations from the payment gateway server:

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('ToyyibPay');

$options = [
    'billCode' => 'samplebillcode'
];

$response = $gateway->completePurchase($options)->send();

$response = $gateway->completePurchase($options)->send();

$response->isSuccessful(); // is the response successful?
$response->isRedirect(); // is the response a redirect?
$response->getTransactionReference(); // a reference generated by the payment gateway
$response->getTransactionId(); // the reference set by the originating website if available.
$response->getMessage(); // a message generated by the payment gateway
```
